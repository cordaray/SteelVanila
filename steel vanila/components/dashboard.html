STEEL VANILA
We use html to wrap the body as a convention, but it can also work only with body
as the query selector looks for the body tag and looks for the div a script within
-->
<html>
  <body>
    <script>
      /* This can be used as a wake up event for this HTML Component */
      console.log('Dashboard internal script triggered!')
    </script>
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <p>Description</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
